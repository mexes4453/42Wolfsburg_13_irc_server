# ft_IRC

Hi there and welcome to our implementation of the 42 Core Curriculum project 'ft_irc' where we construct our very own IRC server.
This server can handle multiple clients at the same time and is written entirely in C++98.

Feel free to dig in and try out some things.

# How to start:
* Get the appropriate IRC client installed. We recommend Hexchat, since we had it's handling in mind, when developing our server.
* Get the repo onto your machine and cd into the appropriate directory.
* Use 'make' to have the binary compile.
* Now you may want to test this IRC Server locally, which you can do by choosing any of the ports between 1024 and 65535. Also, decide on a password.
* You are ready to run the program with both commands like so: './ircserv 49152 PASSWORD
(*) Replace 'PASSWORD' with a character sequence of your choosing.

# Have fun testing!
If you have any comments or suggestions, please let us know!
